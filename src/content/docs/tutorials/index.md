## About Tutorials

A tutorial is a practical activity, in which the student learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal.

A tutorial serves the user’s acquisition of skills and knowledge - their study. Its purpose is not to help the user get something done, but to help them learn.

Tutorials - learning-oriented guides that describe practical steps and are intended to serve our study.
A tutorial in other words is a lesson.
