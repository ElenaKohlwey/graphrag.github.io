### A - F

- Cypher -- a common name for ISO-GQL (like Javascript to Ecmascript)

### G

- Generative AI (GenAI) -- artificial intelligence utilizing foundation models to generate content

- Graph-based indexing -- 
  - See [Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921)

- Graph embedding -- a vector embedding of a node, relationship, or other graph structure

- Graph-Guided Retrieval -- 
  - See [Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921)

- GraphRAG -- RAG using a knowledge graph

### H - Z

- Labeled Property Graph (LPG) -- an alternative name for the Property Graph Model

- LLM -- Large Language Model, a GenAI foundation model specializing in text

- Node -- generally, a thing somehow connected to other things
  1. in a property graph, a node is a data record connected by relationships
  2. in mathematics, a point where two or more curves, lines, or edges meet (a vertex)

- Property Graph Model (PGM) -- the data model of a graph database composed of nodes and relationships

- RAG -- Retrieval Augmented Generation is a software design pattern for integrating a data source into the orchestration layer of a GenAI application

- Relationship - a data record containing an ordered pair of nodes in the Property Graph Model

- Vector -- a matrix with one row or column

- Vector Embedding -- a vector representation of other data. Can be derived from words, images or even graph structures

- Vertex -- 
  1. in geometry, the meeting point of two lines that form an angle
