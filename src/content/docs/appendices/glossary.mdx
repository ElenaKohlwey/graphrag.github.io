### A - F

### G

- Graph-based indexing -- 
  - See [Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921)

- Graph embedding -- a vector embedding of a node, relationship, or other graph structure

- Graph-Guided Retrieval -- 
  - See [Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921)

- GraphRAG -- RAG using a knowledge graph

### H - Z

- Labeled Property Graph (LPG) -- an alternative name for the Property Graph Model

- LLM -- Large Language Model

- Node -- generally, a thing somehow connected to other things
  1. in a property graph, a node is a data record connected by relationships
  2. in mathematics, a point where two or more curves, lines, or edges meet (a vertex)

- Property Graph Model -- the data model of a graph database composed of nodes and relationships

- RAG -- Retrieval Augmented Generation

- Relationship - a data record which pairs two nodes in the Property Graph Model

- Vector -- a matrix with one row or column

- Vector Embedding -- a vector representation of other data. Can be derived from words, images or even graph structures

- Vertex -- 
  1. in geometry, the meeting point of two lines that form an angle
